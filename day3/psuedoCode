## Algorithm for finding largest number in list

listD = [2, 4, 1, 0 , 230, 10, 15]

1. Start with the 1st number in list

2. Set max_num to first number in list

3. Compare each number to max_num

4. If number is bigger, update max_num

5. Print max_num

6. End



## Algorithm for assigning class marks in a list of dictionaries

1. Start

2. Check the first student's mark

3. If the mark is equal to or above 50%
        Set the grade key's value to 'pass'
    
    Else 
        set the grade to 'fail'


4. Repeat for every item in list until the end of list

5. Print the number of people who passed and those who failed

6. End


#class dict 
[
    {
        "name" : "Matthew",
        "percentage" : 50
        "grade" : ""
    },
    {
        "name" : "Mark",
        "percentage" : 30
        "grade" : ""
    },
        {
        "name" : "Luke",
        "percentage" : 70
        "grade" : ""
    },
    {
        "name" : "John",
        "percentage" : 43
        "grade" : ""
    },
]
